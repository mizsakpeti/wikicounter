# Project TODO

## Setup

Tasks when setting up the project

- [x] Update the fields in the `pyproject.toml` file
- [x] Update the README.md file
- [x] Update the LICENSE file (if needed)

## Development

- [x] Implement the word counting functionality with tests
- [x] Add the Wikipedia API integration
- [x] Implement the FastAPI service
- [x] Add tests for the FastAPI service
- [ ] Increase the performance of the Wikipedia API integration (async io)
  - With the current implementation using `Wikipedia-API`, the async support is limited.
  - WikiMedia has rate limits, so we need to be careful with the number of requests.
  - Accessing all the links on a page can be slow, especially if the page has many links.

## Improvements

- [ ] Better text-processing for word counting for special characters. How to define a word?
- [ ] Verify if the full text of the page is retrieved correctly
- [ ] Containerize the application for easier deployment
